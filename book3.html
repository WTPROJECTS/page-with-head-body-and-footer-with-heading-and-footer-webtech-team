    <p><b>DESCRIPTION :</b>Five years ago, a tragic murder-suicide rocked the small town of Little Kilton when school girl Andie Bell was brutally murdered and her boyfriend, Sal Singh, was ultimately accused before seemingly taking his own life. But 17-year-old Pippa, a brilliant and determined student, is convinced that the real killer is still out there, lurking in the shadows. Using her wit and cunning, she launches a secret investigation, posing as a student working on a school project about media involvement in the case, and teams up with Sal's younger brother Ravi to uncover the truth and clear Sal's name.

        As they dig deeper, Pippa and Ravi embark on a thrilling journey of discovery, interviewing key players and unearthing shocking new evidence. But they soon realize that they're not the only ones hunting for the truth, and they must race against time to stay ahead of the killer, who will stop at nothing to keep their secrets buried.
        
        Through sheer determination and unwavering courage, Pippa and Ravi manage to crack the case and bring the real killer to justice, not only solving Andie's murder but also uncovering a web of lies and corruption that had been hiding in plain sight. Their findings not only clear Sal's name but also puts the actual killer behind bars. As their project goes public and the media's attention is drawn, the town is shocked by the revelation of the true story behind the tragic event, and the characters are hailed as heroes for their bravery and persistence in the face of danger.</p>
