    <p><B>DESCRIPTION: </B> “There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal.”

        “Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth.”
        
        “People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed.”
        
        “So many people say, ‘Oh, I’m not interested in money.’ Yet they’ll work at a job for eight hours a day.”
        
        “Thinking that a job makes you secure is lying to yourself.”
        
        “Intelligence solves problems and produces money.”
        
        “You must know the difference between an asset and a liability and buy assets.”
        
        An asset puts money in your pocket. A liability takes money out of your pocket.
        
        “Illiteracy, both in words and numbers, is the foundation of financial struggle.”
        
        “Money often makes obvious our tragic human flaws, putting a spotlight on what we don’t know.”
        
        “Cash flow tells the story of how a person handles money.”
        
        “Most people don’t understand why they struggle financially because they don’t understand cash flow.”
        
        “The number-one expense for most people is taxes.”
        
        Higher incomes cause higher taxes. This is known as “bracket creep.”
        
        “More money seldom solves someone’s money problems.”
        
        “The fear of being different prevents most people from seeking new ways to solve their problems.”
        
        “A person can be highly educated, professionally successful, and financially illiterate.”
        
        “Many financial problems are caused by trying to keep up with the Joneses.”
        
        Once you understand the difference between assets and liabilities, concentrate your efforts on buying income-generating assets.
        
        “The problem with simply working harder is that each of these three levels takes a greater share of your increased efforts. You need to learn how to have your increased efforts benefit you and your family directly.”
        
        “Wealth is a person’s ability to survive so many numbers of days forward—or, if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?”</p>
